string = "Ive tried a few antidepressants over the years citalopram fluoxetine amitriptyline  but none of those helped with my depression insomnia &amp; anxiety. My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common  weight gain Ive actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me."
